# React using Storybook 

```
Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. 
This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start 
up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.
```

### Install
Use the Storybook CLI to install it in a single command. Run this inside your existing projectâ€™s root directory:

```terminal
npx sb init
```

Check that everything worked by running:

```
npm run storybook
```
